    <p>Before the modern era, most major economics used the Gold standard. A country’s currency was directly linked to a specific weight of gold. You could in theory walk into a bank and swap your paper bills for the physical metal. The systme was very stable, but also very rigid. Governments couldn’t print money to fight recessions or fund wars without having the physical gold to back it up. After the chaos of great depression and WWII, world leaders wanted a more flexible system.</p>
<p>As WWII neared its end, delegates from 44 nations met in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to design a new financial architecture. They created a “pegged” system, the US dollar was the only curreny that tied to gold and it was used as the “reserve currency”. Other currency was pegged to US dollars.</p>
<p>By the late 1960s, the system was cracking. The US was spending heavily on the Vietnam War and Great society programs. To fund these projects, the government had to print more money. There were far more dollars circulating globally than there was gold in Fort Knox to back them.</p>
<p>Famously, the then French president Charles de Gaulle was the Bretton Woods System as a “racket” that gave the United States an “exorbitant privilege.” The US was cheating in this sytem, because the dollar was the world’s reserve currency, the US could run massive deficits to fund its war and its domestic spending without facing a bill. While other countries have to keep their budgets balanced, the US can just keep printing dollars, knowing the rest of the world had to catch them.</p>
<p>In 1965, De Gaulle declared that international trade should be based on an indisputable monetary basis, and that basis is gold. He decided to call the Americans’ bluff. He systematically trading in France’s surplus US dollars for actual gold from the US treasury at fixed rate of <code>$35</code> per once, and literately sent the French Navy across the Atlantic to pick up the gold bars and bring them back to Paris.</p>
<p>De Gaulle’s move started a “run on the bank.” Other countries like West Germany and the UK saw this and realized the US didn’t have enough gold to cover all the dollars in the market. By 1971, the US gold stock had plummeted. Nixon was faced with two choices: Drastically cut spending and raise interest rates, which was a political suicide, or default. Nixon chose the later.</p>
<p>In August 1971, President Richard Nixon unilaterally ended the direct convertibility of the USD to gold. This effectively ended the Bretton Wood system. Currencies began to float against each other based on market demand rather than a fixed gold price. We entered the era of Fiat Currency.</p>
<p>Before 1971, the US dollar was pegged to gold at <code>$35</code> per once, once the link was cut off, gold was no longer a fixed rate currency anchor but a freely traded commodity. This led to massive volatility. There was an immediate surge on the gold price, by 1972, it already jumped to <code>$63.84</code>, an 82% increase. The entire 70s was a moonshot of the gold price, by 1980, it reached the peak of <code>$850</code> per ounce. Bear in mind that there were already excessive US dollars circulating around the globe, this surge was just a reality check.</p>
<p><img src="../images/gpnixo.webp" width="400" /></p>
<p>Paradoxically, the Nixon Shock ushred the Fiat Currency Era. Despite being turbulent at the beginning, the US dollar eventually became even more dominant, because they are no longer any alternative “anchor.” In Bretton Wood era, the US had to worry about the gold reserve, but in the Fiat Currency era, as long as the rest of the world can catch the inflation, there is no consequence for the US. It’s effectively exporting inflation, money feels free. In another word, it’s stealing from the rest of the world.</p>
<p>These are downsides of using fiat currency as the reserve currency. To keep the world supplied with dollars, the US must run a trade deficit. Which means it has to import more than it exports. This put a pressure on the US manufacturing industry, and it’s the reason why we have the Rust Belt today. Being the reserve currency can also cause asset bubbles. With massive demand on the US dollar, all the extra liquidity has to go somewhere, and it often flows into the stock market or real estate, making houses and stocks much more expensive.</p>
<p>The Nixon Shock created a vaccum of stability, leading to high inflation and economic stagnation in the 70s. In response, a new economic philisophy took hold, championed by figures like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thachter, called Neoliberalism. Since the money was no longer tied to gold, the focus shifted to market discipline. Neoliberalism is tailored towards the reality that the US dollar as a fiat currency is been used as the world reserve currency.</p>
<p>Four pillars of neoliberalism: Deregulation, Privatization, Austerity, and Free Trade. To deregularize, the US government was removing the “red tape” from financial markets. It sold state-owned industries to private companies to increase competitition. The government was fiercely cutting the spending to control inflation and lowering tariffs to allow currencies to flow across borders easily.</p>
<p>The Fiat Currency is an unfair system, yet it ran for decades since the 70s. It hasn’t broken becasue of force and trust. First of all, the US military had absolute dominance in the world, so nobody can challenge it head on. With a strong military support, the US government can force unfair policies to the rest of the world without radical confrontation. The US also has the deepest financial markets and a relatively transparent legal system, people feel they can live with it than a gold backed currency from an unstable dictatorship.</p>
<p>The peak of Neoliberalism was the creation of the “Chimerica.” After 10 years of cultural revolution and after the death of Mao, Chinese officials was fed up with the constant social movements. In 1978, Deng decided a massive economic reform that completely turned the direction of the country. He openned up for free trade and encouraged private sector. Coincidentally, it’s the time that the US was having trouble with Nixon Shock, the massive 10% inflation lasted for years, <code>$1000</code> dollar in 1970 lost half of its purchasing power in 1980. A sudden emergence of a huge market like China was exactly what the US need: a humpster to export its inflation.</p>
<p>Since the 80s, China was gradually building up its financial sector. Initially through investors from Hongkong, Taiwan, Macau, and Japan, and slowly created more and more ties with the rest of the world. By the mid 90s, China already had a stable market for foreign investment. The US-China trade accelerated since 1990s, large amount of US investment went into China. These money came from the overpriced US stock market, and flooded the Chinese finacial market. The dying manufacturing industry in the US was shifted to China along with this tide of investment. By 2000, the ecnomic of these two countries are already fundamentally tied together, created the so called “Chimerica.”</p>
<p>Chimerica works like this: China did the saving and the manufacturing, America did the spending and the consuming. First, China sells gadgets to Americans for US dollars, China doesn’t like to spend these dollars, otherwise it will make Yuan too expensive and hurt exporting. Instead, China lends those dollars back to the US by buying US Treasury bonds. This keeps the US interest rates low, so American can borrow more money to buy more from China.</p>
<p>For the last 30 years, Chimerica was essentially a subsidy for the American lifestyle. It was a perfect machine for delivering cheap goods for the US consumers while keeping the bill hidden. Under the peak of Chimerica, which was around 2001 to 2018, China’s massive labor force and undervalued currency created the so called China price, the lowest possible price from IPhone to T-Shirts. Because China lend money back to the US through the US Treasury, US get what they spent back so they can buy more stuff.</p>
<p>Chimerica leads to cheap price to the US consumers, but it’s a disaster for the US producers. Since neoliberalism took over America, people in the service sector like tech, finance, marketing are getting high salaries and cheap Chinese goods, meanwhile the working class people in the Rust Belt are facing unemployment. Factories are shutdown because they cannot compete with the Chinese price. For these workers, it’s an era of decline.</p>
<p>Chinese currency is purposefully kept undervalued by the Chinese government to keep the export competitive. This ensures the Chinese price, but it also means people working in China get paid much less than they deserved. Since Deng’s reform, an entire class of farmer rushed into cities to find a factory job, which was usually paid better than farming. However, what they got paid is just a small fraction of what the product they worked on can be sold in the US. When the US consumers are buying cheap goods to sustain the extravagant American lifestyle, these migrant farmers usually have to cram in the factory domitory, save all the money to send back to their family back in the country side.</p>
<p>Chimerica was in decline since 2018, and is coming to its end in the Trump era. In 2018, we had the first US-China trade war. The Trump administration argued the US was “losing” because of its massive trade deficit. He imposed 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. China then retaliated with massive tariffs on American soybeans and pork. The trade war escalated to the tech front, Huawei was backlisted by the US. In 2020, China compromised by agreeing to buy an extra <code>$200 billion</code> of American goods. But in reality, becasue of the disruption of Covid, China ended up buying less than 60% of what it promised. The first trade war was mostly around economics, the Chimerica structure was kept intact.</p>
<p>Since Trump’s second turn, Trump put massive tariffs on most major countries, claimed it being a strategy to make money from foreigners for the US. Tariffs on Chinese goods went as high as 145% on certain categories. China fought back with rare earth exports, which it has the global monolopy. Rare earth are minerals essential for high end manufacturing, without it the high tech industry has to be idle. This back and forth created a de facto mutal embargo for a short time, nearly halting direct trade between the two. Xi and Trump met in late 2025 to negotiate a truce, but no doubt after all this, “Chimerica” will no longer be the same as what it was.</p>
<p>Enslavery and coercion in 21st century are done silently. The migrant worker in Shenzhen will never understand why he worked so hard yet get paid so little to just get by while others are able to afford luxuries, the Rust Belt worker cannot figure out why the US lost its manufacturing industry and they had to loses their jobs. Everyone has “freedom”, but very few can thrive. The Chimerica is a 30 years cycle, and we are standing at the crossroad of the next cycle. Someone will be winner and some will be loser. Who will be sacrificed in the next 30 years?</p>
