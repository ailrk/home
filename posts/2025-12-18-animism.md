Animism can be understood as the way children naturally perceive the world. In early childhood, objects, places, and living beings are experienced as possessing distinct spiritual essences. Children talk to animals, fear monsters under the bed, or treat a tree as a companion. As people grow older, their cognitive structures are reshaped to conform to the societies they inhabit—societies that are, for the most part, no longer animistic.

In ancient societies, however, highly artificial and abstract social frameworks had not yet emerged. There was no monotheism, no materialism, no modern political ideologies, and no systematic metaphysics. People largely retained this childhood mode of perception into adulthood. As they shared these experiences communally, collective spiritual meanings emerged. This constituted the earliest form of religion.

Animism is fundamentally about interconnectedness and universal animation. An animist perceives all things as possessing a soul or inner vitality, and assumes that communication between beings is possible. A hunter may apologize to an animal before killing it; rituals are performed before cutting down a tree; the deceased are believed to remain spiritually present. Humans are not seen as superior to the rest of existence, but as participants within a vast, interconnected network of relations.

Animism does not ask whether something is “true” in an abstract sense; instead, it asks whether a relationship is properly maintained. Spirits are perceived as ubiquitous, and interactions with them must be handled carefully. When animists speak of gods or spirits, they do not treat them as metaphors. Their existence is taken for granted rather than philosophically justified. Psychological experience itself is understood as part of reality, not as something separate from it.

In some civilizations, animism evolved into polytheism, as in ancient Greece. When spirits are personified into distinct characters, they become detached from specific objects. Zeus is no longer an individual thunderstorm, but the god of thunder itself. Through this process, spirits are abstracted, and hierarchical structures emerge. Nature becomes governed by higher beings, and humans relate to these beings primarily through worship rather than mutual coexistence.

In China, animism followed a different trajectory. Rather than being replaced, it was gradually absorbed into an overarching cosmology. Concepts such as Heaven, Earth, and Humanity (天地人), yin and yang (阴阳), the Five Phases (五行), Dao (道), qi (气), and principle (理) emerged as increasingly abstract ways of articulating the same animistic intuition. Religious life shifted away from the worship of anthropomorphic gods toward harmonizing human existence with cosmic patterns. The intricate, personal negotiation with spirits was transformed into li (礼), ritual propriety, which in turn shaped family structure and bureaucratic order.

In the modern, highly rationalized world, life often feels fragmented and confusing. Animistic societies may not have experienced the same existential confusion. They perceived the world directly, acted within it without excessive abstraction, and carried fewer ideological burdens. They lived within a coherent framework of meaning and died with a sense of spiritual continuity. For modern, materially oriented humans, such a world is increasingly difficult to imagine. It survives, if at all, only as a faint echo within our cultural lineage.
