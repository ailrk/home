In the late 15th and early 16th centuries, Italy stood at the center of European culture yet suffered from deep political fragmentation. The Italian peninsula was divided into competing city-states—Florence, Milan, Venice, Naples, the Papal States—all locked in constant rivalry. These conflicts invited foreign intervention. France and Spain skillfully exploited Italian disunity, turning Italy into a battlefield for greater imperial ambitions.

Florence, once governed by the increasingly powerful Medici family, briefly attempted a republican experiment between 1494 and 1512. Among its civil servants was a young diplomat named Niccolò Machiavelli, who witnessed firsthand both the potential of civic administration and the brutal consequences of political weakness. When the Medici returned to power in 1512 with Spanish support, the republic collapsed. Machiavelli was dismissed, imprisoned, tortured, and ultimately exiled from public life.

Hoping to regain favor, he wrote *The Prince* in 1513 and dedicated it to the ruling Medici. Ironically, the book that would reshape political theory failed in its immediate aim: Machiavelli did not obtain a government position. Yet his misfortune produced one of the most consequential texts in Western political thought.

Before Machiavelli, political thought in Europe was immersed in Christian moral philosophy, deeply influenced by scholastic traditions such as those found in Dante’s works. Politics, morality, and divine judgment were inseparable. Dante famously placed contemporary political figures in heaven or hell based on their earthly political actions, reinforcing the belief that leaders were judged within a moral system rooted in Christian doctrine.

Machiavelli rejected this worldview. For him, politics should be understood and practiced independently of Christian ethics. He observed that in the real world, moral purity led to political fragility. A righteous ruler who refused to act ruthlessly would be quickly overwhelmed by rivals and foreign powers. As he bluntly argued: a saint cannot survive in politics. Power belonged not to the good, but to the capable.

Thus, Machiavelli proposed a new principle:

> Political success must be judged by results, not by moral intentions.

This is the core of what we now call political realism.

For Machiavelli, ancient Rome provided the model of effective statecraft. Rome became powerful because its leaders acted without being constrained by Christian ideals (which, of course, did not exist at the time). They made calculated decisions—sometimes harsh, even brutal—to secure stability. Violence and deception were not ends in themselves, but tools to achieve unity and strength.

By contrast, Machiavelli saw the Italian states as weak, constrained by excessive concern for moral appearance. A ruler who obeyed rigid religious morality could not withstand rivals who were willing to lie, betray, or seize opportunity. This weakness allowed France and Spain—whom Machiavelli considered barbaric compared to Italy’s rich culture—to dominate Italian affairs.

Thus, Machiavelli believed that Italy needed unity at any cost, even through actions deemed cruel. If cruelty achieved peace and independence, it was morally defensible. Evil committed for a greater political good was not only acceptable, but necessary.


One striking feature of Machiavelli’s writing is his silence regarding the afterlife. He did not argue against religion; instead, he simply ignored religious reward altogether. His message was pragmatic:

> A ruler must secure success in this life, not gamble on virtue for a life that may not exist.

To govern is to deal with humans as they truly are—self-interested, ambitious, and deceitful. A prince must therefore learn to be both lion and fox, strong and cunning, unbound by moral chains yet guided by strategic purpose.


After failing to regain political power, Machiavelli retreated to a quiet farm near Florence. In poverty and boredom, he wrote not only political treatises but also comedy. His play *The Mandrake* (La Mandragola) reveals his worldview in another form.

The plot centers on a young man who deceives an old husband to seduce his wife. Every character acts out of self-interest: the husband desires an heir, the wife shifts loyalty to a more appealing lover, and the young seducer attains his goal through manipulation. No one is driven by moral virtue; everyone pursues desire masked in clever justification.

The message echoes *The Prince*: the winner is the one who understands and exploits human nature, not the one who clings to ideal morality.


It is no surprise that Machiavelli’s works were condemned by the Church. They did not merely challenge political norms—they undermined the moral foundation of Christian authority. To separate politics from religion was to take away the Church’s power to define legitimate rule.

Yet Machiavelli offered something new: a political science based on observation, not dogma; on reality, not ideals. He forced Europe to confront a difficult truth: power is governed not by angels, but by humans.


### Conclusion

Machiavelli may have written *The Prince* in hopes of regaining a position in Florence, but the work transcended his personal ambition. From the instability of the Italian states and the opportunism of foreign powers, he derived a new vision of politics—one liberated from Christian moral constraints, grounded in realism, and focused on tangible success.

He failed to serve the Medici again, but he became the intellectual architect of modern political thought. In seeking to impress a ruler, he instead changed how the world understands rulers.
