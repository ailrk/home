Ottowa is the captial of Canada, but Quebec is the real epicenter of Canadian politics.

Quebec was initially a French colony, later was invaded by the british. The protestant Brits took over the trade business, and the French stayed their self sustained catholic lifes. French speaking Quebecois have a strong identity, they refuse to mixed with others and insists speaking French.

Canada became a self-governing dominion in 1867, uniting several provinces into a federal state. Quebec, unlike other provinces, was founded by both British and French. The French population accept the union in the condition that their langauge, culture, catholic traditions will be protected.

The 1960s marked a turning point known as the quite revolution. Quebec rapidly transformed into a traditional catholic-led society into a secular, modern state. Under the slogan "Maitres chez nous" (Masters of our own house), the provincial government took control of education, health, and the economy (e.g Hydro-Quebec). This era birthed a form of "Quebec Nationalism", leading to two sovereign referendums that nearly saw the province secede, forcing the federal government to prioritize Quebec's demand to keep the country together.

Quebec holds 23% seats in the House of Common, a dispropotional amount of political power compare to its population. Quebec voters are willing to swing between parties, the province often determine who wins a federal majority. All political parties have to tailor their policies to appeal specifically to Quebec interests.
