Modernism emerged as a response to the significant changes in Western culture and society. Such as industrialization, secularization, the growing influence of science, tecnological innovations, and the geopolitical shifts afte world war I.

Modernism is characterized by a rejection of the past. Modernists belive that they are part of a new age, and the traditional forms and conventions were outdated and irrelevant in the modern world. They therefore sought to create new and original forms that reflected the changing world, emphasizing experimentation, abstraction, and subjective experience. This movement was evident in all areas of culture, including art, literature and even architecture. In art, for example, modernist artists such as Pablo Picasso rejected traditional artistic forms, such as realism and romanticism. They experimented with new forms and techniques such as abstraction and surrealism, challenging viewers' perception and understanding  of the world, and help move art from being materialist to becoming more spiritualist. While in literature, modernist writers such as James Joyces, Virginia World rejected traditional narrative structures, they sougth to create new ones, such as stream of consiousness narrations and non-linear narratives, that reflected the fragmentic and chaotic nature of the modern world.

In general, modernist art, painting, music etc. reflected the deracinated experience of life in which tradition, community, and faith were eroding.

Modernism is also characterized by the focus on the individual. Modernists believe that individual is the key to social and cultural progress. As such, they emphasis the importance of personal atonomy and freedom, both thought and action, which contributed to the growing sense of individualism and relativism. Such empasis is evident in all areas of modernist culture, especially in arts and philosophy.

Lastly, modernism is characterized by a belief in the potential of science and technology as a key to progress and the creation of a better world. This belief however, was disillusioned by the mechanized mass slaughter of the first world war. Which fueled modernist distrust in reason, and doubt in progress and moral improvement of society.

Despite its many cotributions to the modern society, modernism was viewed as a threat to traditional values and social structures. Some thinkers feared that will lead to breakdown of social order and the loss of moral values. Others on the other hand, saw modernism as a source of alienation, as individuals became increasingly isolated and disconnected from one another in the modern urban environment. Still many view modernism as closely tied to colonialism as European powers used the idea of progress and modernization to justify there colonial progress in Africa, Asia, and Americas. This had a profound impact on the cultures and societies in these regions, as traditional ways of life was disrupted, replace by new forms of social, economic and political organization.
