Large numbers of Western Europeans (British, Spanish, Portuguese, French, etc.) immigrated to North and South America. Over generations, most assimilated quite thoroughly into the emerging societies of the "New World" — adopting local languages, customs, and identities.

In contrast, many Chinese, Japanese, and Indian diaspora communities tend to maintain distinct ethnic enclaves ("circles") for much longer — even across multiple generations. These groups often preserve language, cuisine, social networks, and cultural practices more strongly.

Interestingly, if you consider Chinese who "immigrate" among provinces, they assimilate pretty easily. Someone from Sichuan moved to Shanghai can adopt the local dialects, cultural, and customs, and completely assimilate within 1 generation.

After over three centuries of Spanish rule, Filipinos today are widely considered "Hispanic" in culture — with strong Catholic influences, Spanish loanwords, surnames, and other lasting elements. This shows deep assimilation into the colonizer's framework.

However, despite nearly two centuries of British rule, modern India has not become significantly "Anglicized" in the same way. Instead, the cultural flow seems reversed: Britain has imported many Indian cultural elements.

The Mongol Empire shook much of Eurasia, yet the conquerors themselves largely assimilated into the cultures they ruled:

- In China, Mongol descendants blended in and became indistinguishable from Han Chinese.
- In Persia, they converted to Islam and merged into Persian/Islamic society.
- In the Mongolian heartland, even the original Mongols adopted Tibetan Buddhism, losing much of their earlier "horse-rider warrior" nomadic identity.

Overseas Chinese in many Southeast Asian countries (e.g., Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Philippines) often remain more culturally "Chinese" than people in mainland China itself. Rather than being assimilated, they frequently influence and partially assimilate local societies, usually through business dominance, education, and cultural presence.

Why some people are easier to assimilate then others? Many factors are commonly discussed: social status, economic power, length of exposure, discrimination, language similarity, etc. but I believe these are all secondary. The real reason lies in the "civilization core", the religion, philosophy, and spiritual essence that is built into the DNA of people.

Is the moral standard based on shame or sin? Is the framework of the society built on top of trade or agriculture? Freedom and unity, which one is more important? Is there one god or many? Is Jesus god? Or does god matter at all? These form the the basis for us to navigate the society. When we stay in one culture, we are blind to them; their answers are so obvious that even asking feels silly. When there are alternatives that challenge default answers, they all of the sudden become visble, vital, and

If immigration happens within a civilization core, people are much more willing to give up their old customs since it doesn't touch their core identity. The opposite is not true. When one cultural has already took over your mind, a complete banishment of the existing one and a holistic submission to a new one is extremely agonizing, it shakes your understanding of what the reality is, and most people don't have the mental capcity to do that. People from countries with strong civilization core who live in a foreign country for a long time will surely feel this: assimilation is just not possible.

Countless evidences proved this over and over again, and it's important for people who live in a society with large amount of immigrants to fully understand. Both immigrants and locals need to understand what they truly want. If the goal is ethical purity and cultural integrity, immigration is the poison. If economical vitality, competitiveness and innovations are the focus, then a high level of cutural tolerance should be expected. The direction needs to be clear, otherwise it simply does not work. Quote from Bertrand Russell, "We either live together or die together."
